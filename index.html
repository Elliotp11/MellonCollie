  <h1>My Software Choice: Spotify</h1>
  <p>As someone who is very into music, I can appreciate the simplistic yet meaningful design of the software for Spotify. I believe that Spotify is well-designed software due to its ease of use, its targeted recommendations, and its consistency. Spotify allows the user to easily continue to listen to music that they have listened to before by showing their recently played music on the home page. Not only this, but Spotify has features where, with the swipe of a finger, you are able to add any song to your favorites, queue the next track, or share a song with others. I can also appreciate the software for Spotify because of the targeted recommendations. I will often find myself listening to music with features such as their “Smart Shuffle” active. This will allow me to shuffle my playlist while also recommending tracks from similar genres and other tracks from my favourite artists. Though what I believe to be one of the most important aspects of a good software design is its consistency. When I open Spotify, whether from my phone, computer, or even gaming system, I can always expect there to be certain features always present. I am always able to access my downloaded music, I am always able to access my custom playlists, and I am always able to discover new music. All in all, I believe that a good software design is the most important aspect of any online product. Software design is important because it allows the software to be flexible and easy to use. With a good understanding of software design, you are able to give users the ideal experience with any product; good software will have users coming back.

 <h2>The Requirements Gathering Phase</h2>
  <p>The requirement’s gathering phase is one of, if not, the most vital phase in the software development process. During the requirements gathering phase, we must look at not only the functional requirements of the software product, but also the non-functional requirements. We can accomplish this through Interviews with the client, questionnaires, surveys, as well as plain observation. When gathering requirements for the software, we must consider what the system can do, which would be a functional requirement, as well as different constraints such as how the system can perform, different data types, and the characteristics of the users for our software. This stage in the software design process is important as it is the basis for all future development. Without this phase, we cannot discern what needs to be added to the software, what specificities are needed, and other vital information to making the software run properly. Without the requirements gathering phase, the communication of the project can be entirely messed up, with clients having different views of what the outcome of the project can look like. This will cause unnecessary wastes of time and money for both the client and the software engineer. </p>
